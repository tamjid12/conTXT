# ConTXT





**Inspiration**

ConTXT was inspired by the lack of unique digital features in note-taking apps. Our goal was to build an app that provided noticeable benefits beyond paper - something that would only be possible with technology.

the key to learning is creating connections between concepts, All of us as students had the shared experience of tough subjects and classes that were hard to understand. We imagined a tool that furthered your understanding using something you already use - your notes.

**What it does**

ConTXT uses algorithms and AI to automatically detect and sort key topics within your notes, then show you the links between your data points in a streamlined, unobtrusive way.

ConTXT aids learning by doing two main things:

Generating visual connections between information
Providing gateways to further exploration of concepts
ConTxT UI offers:

Convenient notetaking and file organization
Keyword and topic synthesis
Visual concept mapping
AI powered research functionality

**How we built it**

The app currently consists of two parts: a hard-coded mock-up and a back-end algorithm. The mock-up provides the layout and basic functionality of the application while the back end works to create smart categories and process user input into topics.

All the backend algorithm was coded on JavaScript. Before typing a single line of code we broke down our idea into its main structural components based on our chosen functions and target audience (Highschool to University students).

A major aspect that we wanted to emphasize was intuitivity and simplicity. We wanted the UI, layout, and processes to feel natural and not subtract from the standard note taking experience We took extra importance to making sure that the functionality was rendered in a way that didn't distract or cause information overload.
