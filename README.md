# ConTXT
Our UofTHackX Project

**Inspiration**

ConTXT was inspired by the lack of unique digital features in notetaking apps. Our goal was to build an app that provided noticeable benefits beyond paper - something that would only be possible with technology.

**What it does**

ConTXT uses algorithms and AI to automatically detect and sort key topics within your notes, then show you the links between your data points in a streamlined, inobtrusive way.

**How we built it**

The app currently consists of two parts: a hard-coded mockup and a backend algorithm. The mockup provides the layout and basic functionality of the application while the back end works to create smart categories and process user input into topics.
